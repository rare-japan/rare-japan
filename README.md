# About rare-japan

A project directed by Thorsten (iOnsen on Github) to help foreigners discover the "Rare Japan".

* it is a a portal to make reservations to a list of selected ryokans
* it provides an end-to-end experience to help foreigners visit Japan, providing all information you need in one place 
* it provides "Off the beaten path” information, especially about “secret” places foreigners usually do not visit because of lack of information, hence th name "rare-japan"

The marketing target: is the “premium” market.

Foreigners often consider Japan as an exotic country. 
The application will lower the “wall” making it easy to travel to Japan without having to worrying about anything.

About the reservation system: the customers do not interact directly with the ryokans, the application manages everything.
The ryokan manageers must have signed a contract with the rare-japan organisation.
