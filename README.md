# About rare-japan
 
A project directed by Thorsten (iOnsen on Github) to help foreigners to place reservations at secluded Onsen Ryokans (traditional Japanese hot spring inns), which either have no English homepage, or not being listed at major booking platforms like "booking.com" etc.
 
## Background

The number of foreign tourists visiting Japan will probably rise above 20 mil. in 2015 and is supposed to further grow towards the event of Olympia in 2020. But these impressive figures are not the trigger for the project. The motivation rather comes from wish to also enable foreigners to experience a part of Japan, which local people broadly cherish, but is often difficult for non-Japanese to access.

Up to the recent years the domestic demand to stay at these facilities was sufficient to sustain business, but this is gradually changing. Hence, some Onsen Ryokans are considering to at least partly shifting there customer portfolio to foreign guests. Some have already taken action by co-operating with international booking platforms, many of them have not (yet).

## Target customer groups

The places we have in mind to collaborate with are basically not suitable for individual tourists on the basic Tokyo – Kyoto – Hiroshima – route, as these people will simply utilize a huge booking platform to book their accommodation.
We are focusing on guests, who maybe have visited Japan before, but intend to discover a Japan “off the beaten path”, which can be very challenging without Japanese language capabilities.

The service of ”rare-japan” will go beyond the booking process; one field is to ensure preparation of the customers for the trip.
As for the Onsen Ryokans: we focus on higher class facilities, which are willing to welcome foreign guests

## Reservation process & billing

We intend to link to the existing reservation systems of the facilities (Japanese language) to retrieve vacancy information and prices.
Billing: If possible, we would like to apply the same method as on e.g. “booking.com”: guests have to input credit card data, but no payment will be initiated. The guest will pay at check-out at the hotel. If this will be too difficult due to the data security reasons, we will have to integrate an online payment service.
 
## Summary

* Multilanguage portal to make reservations at selected Onsen Ryokans (upper class)
* Customer will not interact with the facilities directly until check-in
* Mutual commutation platform for booking process and trip preparation
